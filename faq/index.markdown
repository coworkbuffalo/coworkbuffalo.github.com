* ### What is coworking, exactly?
It’s for people who can work anywhere they can bring a laptop, but are tired of working from home, or coffee shops. It’s for people who get more done by having a place to go, with people nearby. That’s our take. Wikipedia's nerds came to [this consensus definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking): *"Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people, who are still working independently, but who share values, and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same space."*

* ### What’s it like in there?
We have [a few preliminary photos of the space](http://coworkbuffalo.com/images/photos/), with more to come. In words:
  * Four group desks in the front "bullpen" area
  * Five solo glass desks that accomodate raised secondary monitors.
  * Solid chairs
  * Air conditioning and heating
  * Three phone rooms for calls and Skype conferences
  * Windows with a view of Main Street, the Metro Rail trains, and Shea's Buffalo (pretty beautiful at sunset)
  * A full-size fridge and freezer, a microwave, a sink
  * Delicious coffee and tea provisions

* ### How is the Wi-Fi?
Quite solid. It’s a Time Warner Cable business line, which means a stable, honest 50 mbps down and 10 mbps up.

* ### Where is CoworkBuffalo?
[653 Main St., Suite 104](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=m&ll=42.89123039999998%2C-78.8745409&q=coworkbuffalo&spn=0.0031989896548163146%2C0.005821800114064703&output=classic). It’s two doors to the left of the Bijou Grill (facing from Main St.), and across from Shea's Ticket Office. (You typically park on Washington, Ellicott, or another nearby street to the East.

* ### When are you open?
10am-6pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Members and visitors who need earlier access can usually be accommodated, and monthly members will soon get access.

<!-- * ### Where can I park? How can I get there?
You've got a few options:
  * There are surface and multi-level lots nearby that offer not-so-bad daily rates. 
  * 
  * Biking is quite convenient, and of course, bikes are free to park.
  * The Metro Rail stop at Fountain Plaza ([map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=RAIL+at+Fountain+Plaza+Station&hl=en&hnear=RAIL+at+Fountain+Plaza+Station&t=m&z=16)) is three short blocks away. -->

* ### How much does it cost to work at CoworkBuffalo?
$125 per month, $15 per day, and, or $125 for a 10 visit “flex” (use any day) pass that expires in 3 months. Group discounts and other arrangements can also be negotiated.

* ### How can I pay?
We use [DeskTime](https://www.desktimeapp.com/), a nifty desk sharing and payment system, that makes one-time and recurring credit/debit card payments real easy-like.

* ### Who launched this, and why?
[Nick Quaranto](http://twitter.com/qrush), [Kevin Purdy](http://twitter.com/kevinpurdy), [Dan Magnuszewski](http://twitter.com/magnachef), and [Brian Fending](http://twitter.com/fending), with [Kevin Christner](http://twitter.com/sailflyer) and [Michael Macaluso](http://twitter.com/mikemikemac) joining later on. They did not do this with the hopes of retiring early. They just want to try creating something neat and helpful for semi-nomadic workers like themselves. 

* ### What’s the coffee situation?
We buy local or regional coffee roasted _very_ recently: [Joe Bean](http://joebeanroasters.com/), [Public Espresso](http://www.publicespresso.com/), sometimes [Gimme Coffee](http://www.gimmecoffee.com/), and often bags that the founders and friends bring in. We make coffee in a [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/) carafe, and offer individual pour-over [Hario V60 cups](http://www.gimmecoffee.com/galleries/brewing_at_home_part_5_pour_ov/). For those more needing a walk, or off-hours coffee, there are the usual Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks, and Spot options within walking distance.

* ### Where can I eat nearby?
As of December 2015, there are a _lot_ of good spots to eat nearby, probably too many to list. [Here's a Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/lunch/@42.8916723,-78.8743828,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!2m7!3m6!1slunch!2sCoworkBuffalo,+653+Main+St+%23104,+Buffalo,+NY+14203,+United+States!3s0x89d3124e8cee37db:0xe86f491897286e52!4m2!1d-78.8721941!2d42.8916645). Our favorite daily go-to is [Sue's New York Deli](http://www.suesnydeli.com/). Nick also created a [handy-scan grid of Buffalo’s food trucks](http://coworkbuffalo.com/food/), so you can see when they’re on Main Streeet or otherwise nearby.
