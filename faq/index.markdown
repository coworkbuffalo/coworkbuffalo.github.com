title: CoworkBuffalo - FAQ

* ### What is coworking, exactly?
It’s for people who can work anywhere they can bring a laptop, part-time or full-time, and who want something different than the isolation of home and the distracting coffee shop scene. More so, it’s for people who get more done by having a place to go, people nearby, and a sense of of being part of a small, smart community.  That’s our take. Wikipedia's nerds came to [this consensus definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking):
> Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people, who are still working independently, but who share values, and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same space.

* ### What’s it like in there?
We have [some preliminary photos](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uy0r6tkwvei8m7q/Mt8peC1p5U), from before CoworkBuffalo was officially open. We’ll likely have a set of professional photos up soon.  But, for reference:
  * Eight brand new 200 cm desks: four arranged at a long table, two or three against a wall for “heads down time,” one or two in reserve for now.
  * Eight brand new office rocker chairs.
  * Air conditioning and heating.
  * A phone booth (yes, really) for better sound and more privacy on calls.
  * An adjoining office space that’s usually available for in-person meetings (or more phone call space).
  * Windows with a view of City Hall, the new courthouse, and lots of blue sky. 
  * A microwave, a small fridge, a sink and Brita pitcher, and (coming very soon) a coffee station.
  * Big whiteboard.
  * Free snacks.

* ### How could you honestly get more work done around other people?
At a minimum, there is great power in knowing that people can see how many Wikipedia tabs you have open, and whether or not you’re shooting things or stacking cards on your screen. More specifically, there are, sure, some small distractions of people chatting, getting up, and so on. But the big distractions of home (waiting on UPS, guilt over chores, entertainment) and coffee shops (variable music, close quarters, power/Wi-Fi limits) are gone. 

* ### How is the Wi-Fi?
Quite solid. It’s a Verizon Business line, which means a stable, honest 7 mbps up and down.

* ### Where is CoworkBuffalo?
[225 Delaware Ave., Suite 10](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=225+delaware+ave+buffalo+ny&hl=en&sll=42.892308,-78.871676&sspn=0.004826,0.009645&hnear=225+Delaware+Ave,+Buffalo,+Erie,+New+York+14202&t=m&z=16). It’s the [door to the right of Spot Coffee’s outdoor patio](https://www.dropbox.com/s/thuubvywer1rnp6/Cowork_Buffalo_outer_door.jpg), up the stairs, and toward the end of the hall.

* ### When are you open?
10am-6pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Members and visitors who need earlier access can usually be accommodated, and monthly members will soon get access.

* ### Where can I park? How can I get there?
You've got a few options:
  * The lot [directly adjacent to CoworkBuffalo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2h4rfi4gl5jz1fa/parking_picture.jpg) always has spots, and the maximum rate until 6pm is $10.
  * There are pockets of free and cheap street parking nearby. A favorite is Johnson Park ([map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=johnson+park,+buffalo,+ny&ll=42.892819,-78.878703&spn=0.006013,0.013937&hnear=Johnson+Park,+Buffalo,+Erie,+New+York&t=m&z=17)), where there are sometimes $2 all-day meters.
  * Biking is quite convenient, and of course, bikes are free to park.
  * The Metro Rail stop at Fountain Plaza ([map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=RAIL+at+Fountain+Plaza+Station&hl=en&hnear=RAIL+at+Fountain+Plaza+Station&t=m&z=16)) is three short blocks away.

* ### How much does it cost to work at CoworkBuffalo?
$100 per month, $10 per day, and, for a temporary/introductory prices, $75 for 10 “flex” (use any day) passes. Group discounts and other arrangements can also be negotiated.

* ### How can I pay?
We're working to integrate with [DeskTime](https://www.desktimeapp.com/), a nifty coworking and shared desk space management and payment system. In the meantime, we take credit card payments in-person through [Square](https://squareup.com/).

* ### Who’s launching this, and why?
[Nick Quaranto](http://twitter.com/qrush), [Kevin Purdy](http://twitter.com/kevinpurdy), [Dan Magnuszewski](http://twitter.com/magnachef), and [Brian Fending](http://twitter.com/fending). They are not doing this with the hopes of retiring early. They just want to try creating something neat and helpful for semi-nomadic workers like themselves. 

* ### What’s the coffee situation?
We buy locally and freshly roasted coffee whenever possible. We make batches of coffee twice daily in a [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/), and offer individual pour-over [Hario V60 cups](http://www.gimmecoffee.com/galleries/brewing_at_home_part_5_pour_ov/) for when you need in-between beans.
Otherwise, [Spot Coffee](http://www.spotcoffee.com/) is right downstairs (ask for their rotating specialty roast!), Starbucks is across the street, and Dunkin’ Donuts die-hards have a three-block walk. We've got a few mugs, but you can certainly bring your own. 

* ### Where can I eat nearby?
Nick created a [handy-scan grid of Buffalo’s food trucks](http://coworkbuffalo.com/food/), so you can see when they’re on Main Streeet or otherwise nearby.  But the short list of nearby notables: Salsarita’s, Papaya, Spot, and Subway are very, very close, as is the Emerson School’s cafeteria, which has a wide variety of lunch offerings. There’s the Soho burger bar, Bada Bing’s, a pizza joint on Delaware, and quite a few other spots to be listed out soon.
