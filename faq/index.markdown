* ### What is coworking, exactly?
It’s for people who can work anywhere they can bring a laptop, part-time or full-time, and who want something different than the isolation of home and the distracting coffee shop scene. More so, it’s for people who get more done by having a place to go, people nearby, and a sense of of being part of a small, smart community.  That’s our take. Wikipedia's nerds came to [this consensus definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking): *"Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people, who are still working independently, but who share values, and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same space."*

* ### What’s it like in there?
We have [some preliminary photos](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uy0r6tkwvei8m7q/Mt8peC1p5U) from our new space on Main Street. We need to get some professional photos, and how! But, for reference:
  * Eight group desks in the front "bullpen" area (conversation, window views)
  * Five solo glass desks that accomodate raised secondary monitors.
  * Good chairs
  * Air conditioning and heating (notable in Buffalo!)
  * Three phone rooms for calls and Skype conferences
  * Windows with a view of Main Street, the Metro Rail trains, and Shea's Buffalo (pretty beautiful at sunset)
  * A full-size fridge and freezer, a microwave, a sink
  * Free snacks and delicious coffee and tea provisions

* ### How could you honestly get more work done around other people?
At a minimum, there is great power in knowing that people can see how many Wikipedia tabs you have open, and whether or not you’re shooting things or stacking cards on your screen. More specifically, there are, sure, some small distractions of people chatting, getting up, and so on. But the big distractions of home (waiting on UPS, guilt over chores, entertainment) and coffee shops (variable music, close quarters, power/Wi-Fi limits) are gone. 

* ### How is the Wi-Fi?
Quite solid. It’s a Time Warner Cable business line, which means a stable, honest 35 mbps down and 5 mbps up.

* ### Where is CoworkBuffalo?
[653 Main St., Suite 104](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=m&ll=42.89123039999998%2C-78.8745409&q=coworkbuffalo&spn=0.0031989896548163146%2C0.005821800114064703&output=classic). It’s two doors to the left of the Bijou Grill (facing from Main St.), and across from Shea's Ticket Office. (You typically park on Washington, Ellicott, or another nearby street to the East.

* ### When are you open?
10am-6pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Members and visitors who need earlier access can usually be accommodated, and monthly members will soon get access.

<!-- * ### Where can I park? How can I get there?
You've got a few options:
  * There are lots nearby that offer not-so-bad daily rates. On Elmwood, just up from Chippewa (next to Valero gas station), it's $7/day; many lots are similar.
  * There are pockets of free and cheap street parking nearby. A favorite is Johnson Park ([map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=johnson+park,+buffalo,+ny&ll=42.892819,-78.878703&spn=0.006013,0.013937&hnear=Johnson+Park,+Buffalo,+Erie,+New+York&t=m&z=17)), where there are sometimes $2 all-day meters.
  * Biking is quite convenient, and of course, bikes are free to park.
  * The Metro Rail stop at Fountain Plaza ([map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=RAIL+at+Fountain+Plaza+Station&hl=en&hnear=RAIL+at+Fountain+Plaza+Station&t=m&z=16)) is three short blocks away. -->

* ### How much does it cost to work at CoworkBuffalo?
$125 per month, $15 per day, and, or $125 for a 10 visit “flex” (use any day) pass that expires in 3 months. Group discounts and other arrangements can also be negotiated.

* ### How can I pay?
We're working to integrate with [DeskTime](https://www.desktimeapp.com/), a nifty coworking and shared desk space management and payment system. In the meantime, we take credit card payments in-person through [Square](https://squareup.com/).

* ### Who’s launching this, and why?
[Nick Quaranto](http://twitter.com/qrush), [Kevin Purdy](http://twitter.com/kevinpurdy), [Dan Magnuszewski](http://twitter.com/magnachef), and [Brian Fending](http://twitter.com/fending), with [Kevin Christner](http://twitter.com/sailflyer) joining later on. They are not doing this with the hopes of retiring early. They just want to try creating something neat and helpful for semi-nomadic workers like themselves. 

* ### What’s the coffee situation?
We buy locally and freshly roasted coffee whenever possible. We make batches of coffee twice daily in a [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/), and offer individual pour-over [Hario V60 cups](http://www.gimmecoffee.com/galleries/brewing_at_home_part_5_pour_ov/) for when you need in-between beans. We have mugs, but you are very welcome to bring your coolest mug, too. For those more needing a walk, or off-hours coffee, there are the usual Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks, and Spot options within walking distance.

* ### Where can I eat nearby?
Nick created a [handy-scan grid of Buffalo’s food trucks](http://coworkbuffalo.com/food/), so you can see when they’re on Main Streeet or otherwise nearby. In more stationary eats, we have [Sue's New York Deli](http://www.suesnydeli.com/), the [Bijou Grill](http://bijougrille.com/), [Seabar](http://seabarsushi.com/), the [Washington Market](http://thewashingtonmarket.com/), and, very soon (spring 2014?), [Dinosaur Bar-B-Que](http://www.dinosaurbarbque.com/).
