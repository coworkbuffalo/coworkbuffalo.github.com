## Greetings

Hello from 225 Delaware Ave., Suite 10! If you’re getting this, that means one of three things:

+ You’re someone who’s worked at CoworkBuffalo at least once (YAY).
+ You’re someone who’s expressed interest in CoworkBuffalo (HUZZAH).
+ You’ve signed up for this newsletter all on your own, or we’ve cherry-picked you from the great expanse of Buffalo’s mobile working scene as a potential visitor (BE OUR FRIEND).

As for who we are, you’ve likely met at least one or two of us. Generally, we’re four folks who like to work downtown, work around other people, and work to make Buffalo a better place, even if it’s just one or two office spaces at a time. Here’s the roster:

+ [Nick Quaranto](http://twitter.com/qrush)

## Our first social mixer!

Coworking is about getting people together. We want you to join us during the day, but we know how hard it is to carve out time to visit or socialize. Unless there are free drinks and snacks.

Which there will be! From **4-6pm, Thursday, June 21, at CoworkBuffalo (225 Delaware Ave., Buffalo**, we’ll be closing our laptops, loading the projector with undetermined silliness, and inviting our truly dear customers and interested visitors to [check out the space](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uy0r6tkwvei8m7q/Mt8peC1p5U) and have a beer, root beer, or iced tea on us.

RSVP [through Doodle](http://doodle.com/33hwxme9mzmn7aga) by “voting” for the only date option we gave you there, or simply RSVP to this email with a quick “Yes” or “Sorry!” or “[Ich werde da sein mit Glocken auf meine Person](http://translate.google.com/#auto|en|Ich%20werde%20da%20sein%20mit%20Glocken%20auf%20meine%20Person)!” We hope you can make it, and we will hold up nearly any excuse if your boss asks why you’re cutting out early.

## Announcements, upgrades, and our to-do list

We’re a young space, just over a month old. But like the modern urban artist Rick Ross, almost every day we are working to derive greater value for our coworkers through effort and consideration. (That’s what Rick Ross is known for, right? I asked my uncle, who’s a semi-pro Wikipedia editor).

**Recent changes**

+ Our [locally and recently roasted Elm Street Bakery coffee](http://galleries.buffalonews.com/photo.php?gname=gallery_1327442872.txt&item=1) is brewed for everyone at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. It costs just $1 for everyone without a monthly pass. Don’t have a buck on you? We’ll throw it on your tab, and you can pay when you re-up.

+ You can easily make your own pour-over coffee with our awesome beans for $1, too, in about 5 minutes. (Non-caffeine-main-lining monthly members also get this for free).

+ We have a 80-inch projection screen available for talks, meetings, and small events (and, very soon, a projector). Interested in renting the space in off-hours? Ping [work@coworkbuffalo.com](mailto:work@coworkbuffalo.com)

+ Biking to CoworkBuffalo is highly encouraged, and there’s lots of bike parking outside. If you think it might rain while you’re here, you can bring your bike up and stash it around the corner.

**Coming soon**

+ Upgrades to our famous phone booth: wall coverings and a ventilation fan.

+ Printing: Cheap and wireless.

+ A smarter payment and management system, so you can see who’s at CoworkBuffalo, pay without swiping a card, and more.

## What can we do better?

We want to hear from folks who have been to or toured CoworkBuffalo what we can do to make it better. We’re just four people, and we’re trying to do something more than just a bunch of office sub-lets.

Ping us at [work@coworkbuffalo.com](mailto:work@coworkbuffalo.com) with thoughts, questions, considerations, and items for our to-do, to-buy, and to-brew list.
