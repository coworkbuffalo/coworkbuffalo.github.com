## Greetings

Hello again from 225 Delaware Ave., Suite 10! 

It's been a busy few months at CoworkBuffalo, enough so that July's newsletter (and associated meetup) just kept on passin' us by. Like the Pharcyde song, but without the sax break. Anyways! We have more interesting people from more fields working at our space, and we're just really glad to see the word get out and have people keep coming back. Now, down to business.

## Second mixer!

Remember that moment when, after you start a new job, you get your first invitation to hang out with the "crew" outside of work? Well, this is that moment. Unless you went to our first mixer, in which case, this is Déjà vu.


You're invited to join us for free beer, soda, and snacks at the space:

+ **When:** 4-6pm, Thursday, Aug. 23
+ **Where:** 225 Delaware Ave., Buffalo, NY
+ **What:** We close our laptops, fire up our new projector (for real this time), and invite you all to have a drink on us and meet your fellow coworkers.
+ **RSVP:** Whatever works best for you: email us at [work@coworkbuffalo.com](mailto:work@coworkbuffalo.com) with 

## Announcements, upgrades, and our to-do list

Here's what's new at CoworkBuffalo:

**Recent changes**

+ Wireless printing! Thanks to monthly member Kevin Christner, we have an HP unit that's really easy to set up from your desk. When we say "really easy," we mean "No clicks from Mac, and you can even set it up in Linux without "sudo dpkg -i -f *hp*.deb". _Ahem_. Printing costs 15 cents a page B&W, 20 cents color. If you don't mind hooking up to 

+ We switched up coffee providers. We now get shipments every other week from [Rochester's Joe Bean Coffee](http://joebeanroasters.com). They pick out two pounds of their roaster's choice, ship it next-day to us, and we get to brew stuff like Guatemala Chajul (Fair Trade, Organic). If we have any left after the next shipment arrives, well, it's a good day to be hanging around CoworkBuffalo. Wink. Hint.

+ We have a screen, and we have one of two projectors we're deciding on. Interested in renting the space in off-hours? Ping [work@coworkbuffalo.com](mailto:work@coworkbuffalo.com)


**Coming soon**

+ Upgrades to our famous phone booth: wall coverings and a ventilation fan.

+ Printing: Cheap and wireless.

+ A smarter payment and management system, so you can see who’s at CoworkBuffalo, pay without swiping a card, and more.

## What can we do better?

We want to hear from folks who have been to or toured CoworkBuffalo what we can do to make it better. We’re just four people, and we’re trying to do something more than just a bunch of office sub-lets.

Ping us at [work@coworkbuffalo.com](mailto:work@coworkbuffalo.com) with thoughts, questions, considerations, and items for our to-do, to-buy, and to-brew list.
