title: Hey! CoworkBuffalo Has Some Pretty Big News
---

Come Dec. 2, CoworkBuffalo will be serving up its usual mix of strong Wi-Fi, smooth coffee, casual camaraderie, and community gathering space from a new location: **653 Main St., Suite 104**. That's right on soon-to-be-renovated Main Street, across from Shea's Performing Arts Center. We are really excited.

None of us hit the lottery, and we're not taking on investments. We are simply comfortable and confident in our coworking project, and its members, after more than a year of operation. We want to provide the kind of space that helps people get things done and feel good about coming downtown to work, so we found a bigger, more accommodating space, not too far from where we are now. [You can see a few pictures of the space on the landlord's site](http://www.plazagroup.com/units/view/suite_104_653_main_st._buffalo_ny_14203) (until that link comes down).

Those of you who provided feedback on what we could do better and improve around here? We appreciate your input, and you should see a lot of it come to bear in our new space.

## New Features ##

Some of the things we hope you'll like at our new digs:

+ **Three dedicated and sound-protected phone/teleconference spaces**, plus one phone booth you might remember. This is by far our most requested addition, and we made it a priority.

+ Basement storage for bicycles and other gear, with lockers possibly to arrive soon after.

+ Windows! Natural light! We're very keen on getting whatever sunlight we can into the street-facing space, and we're keeping that in mind with every bit of design and build-out we add.

+ A divider for creating impromptu meeting/client space.

+ Dedicated kitchen/coffee area, with dishwasher.

+ Full-size fridge/freezer, for our members who don't anticipate raiding Dinosaur BBQ every weekday.

+ Regular free snacks and an honor-system snack "shoppe"

+ An easier system for reserving the space for evening/weekend meetings, meetups, and other small-group uses.

## Timeline and Details You Should Know ##

+ We will start moving gear and equipment over to the new space starting in mid-November. We will keep tables and basic supplies at the 225 Delaware space through November,  but we might ask you to **hold off on sending packages to 225 Delaware due to arrive after Nov. 15.** People will still be here, and the space will remain open to key-holding monthly members, but for your goods' safety, give us a week or two to make the move.

+ We will, however, **continue to host community meetups at 225 Delaware through Nov. 29, then resume meetups/reservations at the new space on Dec. 3.** We will contact anyone booked to use the space around those dates individually.

This hasn't been the most secret of movesâ€”we do our work on CoworkBuffalo right here at CoworkBuffalo. But now that things are signed and paid and ready to roll, we can't wait to share more of our plans with you, very soon.

See you at the new space. Thank you for coming along with us.
