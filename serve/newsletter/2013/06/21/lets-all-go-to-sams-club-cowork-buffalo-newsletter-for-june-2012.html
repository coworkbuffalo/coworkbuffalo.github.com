<h2 id="a-namegreetingsgreetingsa"><a name="greetings">Greetings</a></h2>

<p>It’s a quiet Friday morning at CoworkBuffalo, but that’s a good excuse to vacuum, wipe down the desks, make some extra-snobbish coffee (<a href="http://www.roastmasters.com/costamicro4.html">Helsar De Zarcero</a>, from Costa Rica, via <a href="http://tonx.org">Tonx</a>), and write to all of our members and community supporters.</p>

<p>This summer has been a pretty busy one so far for CoworkBuffalo, and yet summer has just officially started. Let’s get into it.</p>

<h2 id="a-namenewsnews-and-new-stuffa"><a name="news">News and New Stuff</a></h2>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We were quite pleased to merit a <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130609/CITYANDREGION/130609339"><strong>Buffalo News Sunday feature</strong></a>, one that ably explained the appeal of our space and why it exists. It’s a good read, and we’re not just saying that because one of our moms had it framed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might have noticed that a trio of workers has set up shop (read: moved tables together) in the Suite 9 space. That group is the <a href="http://www.congoleaders.org/"><strong>Congo Leadership Initiative</strong></a>, and they have both an intriguing mission and a smart staff. Also? They’re the beneficiaries of a neat 20’s-themed party at the Hotel Lafayette, <a href="http://www.buffalosummerseve.com/">“Buffalo Summer’s Eve”</a>, starting at 6pm on Friday, June 28. Champagne fountain, y’all.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-stuff">New Stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Artisinal Thumb Drives”</strong> are available in a small Mason jar by the windows in Suite 10. That is, we have a whole bunch of free 1 or 2 GB drives you can use to transfer files, or, most helpfully, print or scan from the multi-function in Suite 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coming soon: Drink and Snack Shoppe.</strong> While we dig this part of town, we know that, to grab impulsive, small snacks and drinks, there’s not a ton of super convenient options nearby. And with the Valero mart at Chippewa &amp; Elmwood disappearing soon (new Delaware North headquarters, don’tcha know), it’s an even longer walk for granola bars, soda, and whatnot. So we’re going to open up a small honor-system snack station soon, where you can grab snacks and drinks for a slim margin over what we buy them for at Sam’s Club or wherever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Smarter package/mail handling.</strong> Even if it’s just a space on the white shelves in Suite 9, we’re thinking about how we can more ably handle your packages for delivery here at Cowork. Even though we’re already far more convenient than chasing down yellow slips and hoping your neighbors don’t feel theft-y, we’re talking to the UPS and FedEx and USPS folks about what kind of delivery security we can set up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Look at this amazing framed birthday gift from <a href="http://primeranolaw.com/">Lisa Primerano</a>.</strong> Just <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/purdman1/8962261285/">look at it</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-namewhatwhat-can-we-do-bettera"><a name="what">What Can We Do Better?</a></h2>

<p>It seems like most of our members are really nice people. Really nice people are forgiving, and might not tell you what you’re doing wrong. But treat us like a Starbucks for a moment, and tell us what you need to make working here as good or better than working from home. <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#064;&#099;&#111;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#098;&#117;&#102;&#102;&#097;&#108;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">Fling us a quick email</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/coworkbuffalo">a tweet</a> if it’s something small.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here is a reasonably short list of things we cannot replicate from your work-at-home experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls from mom (we can’t match that kind of guilt).</li>
  <li>A fridge with depressingly stale office cake you took home from an office birthday party last week (though we’re thinking about a nearly-full-size fridge, so stay tuned!)</li>
  <li>Nearby kids laughing mirthfully, then suddenly breaking into shrieks (as far as we know, Nate from Congo Leaders doesn’t bite interns).</li>
  <li>A neighbor with an oh-so-perfect lawn and landscaping skill to feel bad about (urban farming has not taken root in the Chip Strip yet).</li>
  <li>That moment at around 5:30 p.m. when you’re still working and a friend asks if they can swing by, but you have to stall them because you never quite showered, the living room has old coffee mugs in it, and you’re still wearing a black T-shirt with pet hair all over it (perhaps you could set up a webcam for the remote experience, however).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="as-always-host-your-meetup-here">As Always: Host Your Meetup Here</h2>

<p>Want to host a meetup, meeting, workshop, or other event at CoworkBuffalo? Mail us at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#064;&#099;&#111;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#098;&#117;&#102;&#102;&#097;&#108;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#064;&#099;&#111;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#098;&#117;&#102;&#102;&#097;&#108;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>. We’re usually free for community-minded and non-profit events, and surprisingly cheap for everything else. Members of CoworkBuffalo get priority access, and we can work with others to get them keys.</p>
